## Final Dataviz Project

### Summary of Project

For my final dataaviz project, I intend to outline the inequalities of gender representation in media. Whether it's popular media (like TV shows and movies that we watch) or traditional news media (like newspapers and news channels), women are underrepresented. There is a disjoint between the 50-50 gender distribution reality that we live in, and the media that we consume. There are fewer female leads on TV shows and movies, where there are female characters, they are often based on stereotypes conceived by male writers. On the news, women are often featured because of their personal stories (e.g. crime victim, human interest story) rather than as news-makers or subject matter experts. This misrepresentation is a factor in perpetuating female steoreotypes (not good at math, better at nurturing-type occupations or home-making), which in turn imposes economic costs on society.

### Project Structure

The picture below depicts my first draft of the expected user-journey that the audience will undergo. For this project, my audience will be an educated crowd who may or may not have prior knowledge of this issue. Through my presentation, I hope to create awareness of this issue and convince my audience that this is an issue that affects them personally. It is my hope that they leave the presentation remembering 1 or 2 statistics presented through the data visualisations, and bring this issue up in conversations with their friends. 

In terms of major elements of the story and anticipated data visualisations, I imagine there to be the following:

### Data

A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
