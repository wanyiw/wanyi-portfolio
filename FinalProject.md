## Final Dataviz Project

### Summary of Project

For my final dataaviz project, I intend to outline the inequalities of gender representation in media. Whether it's popular media (like TV shows and movies that we watch) or traditional news media (like newspapers and news channels), women are underrepresented. There is a disjoint between the 50-50 gender distribution reality that we live in, and the media that we consume. There are fewer female leads on TV shows and movies, where there are female characters, they are often based on stereotypes conceived by male writers. On the news, women are often featured because of their personal stories (e.g. crime victim, human interest story) rather than as news-makers or subject matter experts. This misrepresentation is a factor in perpetuating female steoreotypes (not good at math, better at nurturing-type occupations or home-making), which in turn imposes economic costs on society.

### Project Structure

The picture below depicts my first draft of the expected user-journey that the audience will undergo. For this project, my audience will be an educated crowd who may or may not have prior knowledge of this issue. Through my presentation, I hope to create awareness of this issue and convince my audience that this is an issue that affects them personally. It is my hope that they leave the presentation remembering 1 or 2 statistics presented through the data visualisations, and bring this issue up in conversations with their friends. 

In terms of major elements of the story and anticipated data visualisations, I imagine there to be the following:

* Introductory dataviz showing the disjoint between our 50-50 gender distribution reality and the media (See Picture 2 below)
* Dataviz on the gender pay gap and educational attainment: this will highlight that even though women are better-educated, they still earn less. This is to highlight the impact of gender underrepresentation in the media. 
* Dataviz on the underrepresentation of women leaders (political, business, STEM). This is to highlight the impact of gender underrepresentation in the media.
* Dataviz on the 50:50 initiative by the BBC. This is to show that change is possible, and that this is an issue that can be corrected.

### Data

For my dataviz project, I intend to use the following databases or reports. Note this is an initial collation and may change over time.

1. [Global Media Monitoring Project][https://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp-2020-final-reports/] : They track the gender representation in the news, whether it's news presentation like reporting or newscasters, or how women are featured within the news. The data here will go into the introductory dataviz.
2. [Center for Women in TV and Film] [https://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/research/] : This database collates statistics on women in tv and film, including female representation as TV or movie leads and behind-the-scenes roles (e.g. writers, directors etc.). This database will be used in the introductory dataviz.
3. [Women and Hollywood][https://womenandhollywood.com/resources/statistics/] : This database collates statistics on women in tv and film, including female representation as TV or movie leads and behind-the-scenes roles (e.g. writers, directors etc.). This database will be used in the introductory dataviz.
4. [Global Gender Gap Report 2021, World Economic Forum][https://www.weforum.org/reports/ab6795a1-960c-42b2-b3d5-587eccda6023/in-full/gggr2-benchmarking-gender-gaps-findings-from-the-global-gender-gap-index-2021#1-3-performance-by-subindex] : This database is an index on how countries fare on sub-indices related to the gender gap. This includes economic opportunities, educational attainment etc. The data will be used on the dataviz on gender pay gap and educational attainment. 
5. [US Census Data][https://data.census.gov/cedsci/] : I intend to use US Census data on wages, differentiated by gender and occupation. This data will be featured on the dataviz on gender pay gap. 
6. Journal "The effect of media sexism on womenâ€™s political ambition: evidence from a worldwide study"][https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14680777.2018.1468797] : This is an empirical global study showing the correlation between media sexism and women's political ambition. Data from this article will be featured in the dataviz of impact of gender underrepresentation in the media.
7. [BBC 50:50 Initiative] [chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/viewer.html?pdfurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2F5050%2Fdocuments%2F50-50-impact-report-2021.pdf&clen=7972062&chunk=true] : This report captures statistics of the BBC 50:50 initiative which strives for equal gender representation on BBC shows. This will go into the dataviz showing change is possible.

### Method and Medium

I intend to use Shorthand for my presentation. Datavizes will be created through Tableau and/or Datawrapper. I might also use Balsamiq for wire-framing.
