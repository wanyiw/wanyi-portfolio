# Creating the Final Dataviz Project: My Journey (Part 2: Creating a Storyboard and Conducting User Research)

[Back to Part 1](/FinalProject.md)       [Return to Main Page](/README.md)

> In putting together this story, I went from low-fidelity wireframes to high-fidelity charts. Similarly, my storyboard also started growing in fidelity. Here is my journey and thought process.

## Wireframes and storyboards

### 1. Insights from Sketching More Charts

Through the class discussion and more data-gathering, I sketched out a few more charts that might go into the storyboard. The purpose behind these very low-fidelity sketches were to see what kind of charts I might use in my storyboard, it also helped me figure out what are the story elements that might go into my story. The insights I got from these sketches were as follows:

- I want a variety of chart types to keep my story interesting. However, I want to limit myself to about 3 - 4 types so the audience does not have to "relearn" new chart types. 
- One thing I want to keep consistent in my story is the use of colours for male and female. To that end, I found an online resource that helped me to figure out what colours I might assign to the 2 genders. [How to choose different gender colours][https://blog.datawrapper.de/gendercolor/]
- There is a lot that I want to say in my story, there's just too much data I want to present. I will need to prioritise along the way, and can use my user research protocol to help me figure out which charts are more helpful or resonate more strongly with my audience.

### 2. Piecing the Story

As I sketched out the different charts, I started grouping them into story elements (that is pieces of my story). The story elements that emerged were as follows:

- How women are under-represented in the media: charts on how often women are seen in the media, how they are portrayed in film or tv. 
- The real-life impact of media sexism: chart on how women are under-represented in key industries like politics, science and business. 
- Why we should care about closing the gap: chart on the benefits of closing the gender gap. 
- Successful initiatives of closing the gap like the BBC 50:50 initiative or the Olympics achieving gender parity in the 2020 Olympics. 
- Call to Action: I curently have 2 in mind - getting people more aware about media sexism by watching the movie Miss Representation and getting the audience to think about how they can achieve 50:50 gender parity in their own lives. I want to test out how these 2 "calls to action" play out in my user research protocol. 

Based on these story elements, I very roghly sketched out how my storyboard might look like. Putting this together, I start to think about the sequencing of this different pieces. I consider if the impact of media sexism should come first. Again this is something I want to look into more closely as I conduct user research.

### 3. Growing in Fidelity - Using Shorthand

Based on the above process, I use Shorthand to put together my storyboard. This is useful because it allows me to "switch" the sequence of the story around. 

I also use Flourish and Infogram to create my data visualisations, which are 9 in total.

## User Research and Interviews

### 1. Target Audience and Identifying Sample

The target audience for my story "You Can't be What You Can't See" would be the everyday person because I think spreading awareness of this issue of women being misrepresented in the media is something everyone should know. I would say that I have a slight preference for men being the target audience, just because I think that women are more likely to already be aware of this issue compared to men. 

In light of the target audience, I recruited 3 individuals for my user research - 2 men and 1 woman. They are college-educated individuals who are interested in public policy. 

### 2. Interview Script and User Research Protocol

My interview script is as follows:

> Hello. I would like some feedback on a presentation that I am working on. I have a storyboard that I would like you to take a look at. I would appreciate if you could take 10 minutes to go through the storyboard, see what resonates with you, and what you might find confusing. Thank you. 

The User Research Protocol is adapted from the one in class, with key questions that I added in view of some of the queries that arose from my wireframing/storyboarding journey.

### 3. Findings

The table below captures the specific questions posed to 2 persons and their respective feedback.

### 4. Potential Changes

Based on the feedback, I am likely to consider making the following changes:

1. The first thing I'd absolutely change is the flow of the story. I was already of the opinion that the flow is problematic, but the user research resoundingly confirmed my opinion. One user suggested starting with the underrepresentation of women in politics which is well-known issue before linking it to the underrepresentation of women in the media - which is the alternative flow that I had considered before. I think this flow might make more sense. If I have time, I might change the sequence and get user feedback again. 

2. The graphic that users seem to be most confused by is the chart on Olympic athletes. The confusion was due to a couple of reasons
