### Redesign and User Consultation Assignment

In this assignment, my task was to find an existing dataviz, wireframe a redesign of the dataviz, get user feedback on the wireframe and finally build a solution. 
Let's see how this went!

### The Original

Here is the original dataviz that I chose. It's a dataviz from a 
[Pew Research Centre article](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/15/lower-income-parents-most-concerned-about-their-children-falling-behind-amid-covid-19-school-closures/) 
on educational inequalities that have arisen from the COVID pandemic. This particular topic is of interest to me, since i firmly believe that levelling education outcomes is the 
most powerful tool to addressing future inequalities. I chanced upon this article and was struck by the amount of text within the datviz. It occurred to me that Pew datavizes tend
to be quite wordy since they often provide the exact wording of the survey questions that they run, and I was interested in figuring out how datavizes can be utilised to show survey 
findings.

### The Wireframe 

Using the [Few critique method](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf), I gained the following insights which informed my wireframe redesign:

1. A lot of mental effort went into matching survey responses to the question, especially since the "very" response could either be "very satisfied" for one question and then 
"very concerned" for the next question. There was no consistency in this. In the redesign, I tried to reorganise the responses to reduce that mental effort. 
2. The use (or lack of use) of colour in the dataviz firstly made it difficult to compare between the different income groups. I was also confused as to which income group I was
meant to focus on. In the redesign, I used a 2-color scheme (red and gray) to draw the reader's attention to the lower income group while relegating the other income groups to
a more muted color. 
3. Out of the 4 questions displayed in this dataviz, I did not feel that 2 of them added to the story being told. In the redesign, I reduced the data being shown to the 2 questions 
that were relevant to the story. 

With these insights in mind, I produced the following sketch of my proposed redesign:

### User Feedback

The table below captures the specific questions posed to 2 persons and their respective feedback.

| Questions | Person 1 | Person 2|
|---|---|---|
|1. Can you tell me what you think this is? | It is a bar chart depicting inequities in education due to COVID19 for low income children. | This tells me about the reactions of families of various income levels during COVID. |
|2. Can you describe to me what this is telling you? | It is telling me that low income children are disproportionately affected by COVD19 because they have lower access to education. | It tells me that lower income families are less satisfied with how shcool is doing during COVID. |
|3. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? | The income categories in the middle throw me off a little bit. Maybe making them bold or putting them to the left might make it less confusing. | I am confused by the red colour because I feel like I'm supposed to be alarmed by the red, like what percentage would be green? |
| 4. Who do you think is the intended audience for this? | I think the intended audience is either educators or policy makers. | I think it's meant for parents of children in school during COVID. |
|5. What would you change or do differently? | I would consider shifting the income categories to the left and also use different fonts to make a distinction between the title and the headings for % concenerend and % children receiving little/no education. | I would change the red colour of the bar. |

Based on the feedback, I gained the following insights with regard to my wireframe redesign:

1. Red may be too strong of a colour to use, as there are other connotations associated with it such as danger. 
2. People are used to reading from left to right, so having the income levels in the middle was confusing. 
3. There is still quite a bit of text in my chart, and reader may have trouble distinguishing between the different bits of text. 

### The Solution

In response to the feedback, I implemented the following changes:

1. Changed the colour of the responses of the lower-income families from red to blue which is still a brighter colour without the association of danger or failure. This will hopefully lessen the confusion of the reader and not lead them to wonder about unnecessary questions such as what % level is acceptable. 
2. On the feedback of switching the income labels to the left, I decided instead to retain the labels in the middle. This was a considered decision. Quickly sketching a design with labels on the left and bars on the right made it much harder for the reader to easily compare the bars for "concerned" and "receiving little or no online instruction". Leaving the labels in the middle allow easy alignment. Instead to draw attention to the labels, I made them a bigger font and in bold. 
3. I added an underline to the title, to draw more distinction between the title and the text for the 2 questions posed. 

The final redesign is as follows:
