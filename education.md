### Redesign and User Consultation Assignment

In this assignment, my task was to find an existing dataviz, wireframe a redesign of the dataviz, get user feedback on the wireframe and finally build a solution. 
Let's see how this went!

### The Original

Here is the original dataviz that I chose. It's a dataviz from a 
[Pew Research Centre article](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/15/lower-income-parents-most-concerned-about-their-children-falling-behind-amid-covid-19-school-closures/) 
on educational inequalities that have arisen from the COVID pandemic. This particular topic is of interest to me, since i firmly believe that levelling education outcomes is the 
most powerful tool to addressing future inequalities. I chanced upon this article and was struck by the amount of text within the datviz. It occurred to me that Pew datavizes tend
to be quite wordy since they often provide the exact wording of the survey questions that they run, and I was interested in figuring out how datavizes can be utilised to show survey 
findings.

### The Wireframe 

Using the [Few critique method](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf), I gained the following insights 
which informed my wireframe redesign:

1. A lot of mental effort went into matching survey responses to the question, especially since the "very" response could either be "very satisfied" for one question and then 
"very concerned" for the next question. There was no consistency in this. In the redesign, I tried to reorganise the responses to reduce that mental effort. 
2. The use (or lack of use) of colour in the dataviz firstly made it difficult to compare between the different income groups. I was also confused as to which income group I was
meant to focus on. In the redesign, I used a 2-color scheme (red and gray) to draw the reader's attention to the lower income group while relegating the other income groups to
a more muted color. 
3. Out of the 4 questions displayed in this dataviz, I did not feel that 2 of them added to the story being told. In the redesign, I reduced the data being shown to the 2 questions 
that were relevant to the story. 

With these insights in mind, I produced the following sketch of my proposed redesign:
