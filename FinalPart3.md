Based on the feedback, I am considering making the following changes:

1. **Change the story sequence**  :  The first thing I'd absolutely change is the flow of the story. I was already of the opinion that the flow is problematic, but the user research resoundingly confirmed my opinion. One user suggested starting with the underrepresentation of women in politics which is well-known issue before linking it to the underrepresentation of women in the media - which is the alternative flow that I had considered before. I think this flow might make more sense. If I have time, I might change the sequence and get user feedback again. 

2. **Another change to story sequence**  : Another sequence issue that came from user feedback (conducted during Tuesday's in-class exercise) was that the logic flow from $12 trillion wasn't smooth. I had also gotten other user feedback that they were confused about the $12 trillin and what it was there for. To make this clearer, I will be moving up the successful gender parity initiativesm to make it clear that we can achieve gender parity and in doing so, will add $12 trillion to the global GDP. That will also be the last element leading to the call to action, so in a way the $12 trillion is incentive to execute the call to action. 

3. **Chart on Olympic athletes**  :  The graphic that users seem to be most confused by is the chart on Olympic athletes. The confusion was due to a couple of reasons. The first is that it's an interactive graph that audience members have to hit "play", otherwise it just displays the end. I might put it on loop so people see immediately that it's interactive. The numbers are also not in percentages (in fact that's a problem with a lot of the graphics), so I will have to clean that up. 

4.  **Cleaning up charts**  :  There was some feedback on the overall clarity of charts, e.g. use of numbers or percentages, font size being too small or inconsistent. Some of these had to do with the embedding of visualisations into Shorthand. In Part 3, I'll be spending more time making sure charts are consistent and render properly on Shorthand. 

5. **$12 trillion chart**  :  Users had useful feedback on the components that make up this treemap. There is inconsistency in the components used, e.g. alleviating world poverty is something you can spend money on but top 10 net worth is not something you spend money on. I will be refining this treemap to only include components that you can spend money on. This will help with the main point of this chart which is what you can get with $12 trillion.
