# Creating the Final Dataviz Project: My Journey (Part 3: Creating the Final Product)

> The lead-up to the final product incorporated suggestions captured during user feedback, and involved making design decisions to ensure that my data story would resonate with my audience. 

## Changing the Story Sequence

This was the key insight I took away from the user feedback conducted in Part 2 - while certain graphics or images resonated strongly with the participants, most had difficulty with the story flow specifically how one part led to the next. After reflecting on this, I went back to basics and decomposed the story into 5 elements (underrepresentation of women in real life, how the media portrays women, successful attempts at achieving gender parity, benefits of gender parity and the call to action). I played around with different permutations of sequencing the 5 elements and actually got useful feedback from one of the group critique sessions in class. 

I therefore settled on the following sequencing, with attention paid to how each piece connected with the next:

1. Underrepresentation of women in real life (politics, science and business) - This is starting off the presentation because it's the most well-known piece so we're starting with something familiar to the audience. This was an actual suggestion from a participant. 
2. How the media portrays women - I connect this piece to the first by pointing out the similarities between the underrepresentation in real life and how the media portrays women, and then use studies that show the causal relationship between the two. 
3. Successful attempts at achieving gender parity - Having pointed out the causal relationship, I then move into this part which debunks the notion that the gender parity cannot be achieved. In particular, I use the BBC's success story as a counterpoint that the media (if they choose) can achieve gender parity. 
4. Benefits of gender parity - Having established that gender parity is achievable, I discuss why we should do it. This will hopefully get the audience pumped about the next item which is
5. The call to action!

## Clarifying the Call to Action

Another key insight was clarifying the call to action. In some sense, the call to action wasn't clear because it didn't follow after the benefits of gender parity. So the story sequence helped with the motivating the audience to support or execute the call to action. I also added text that elaborated on the 2 calls to action which were to get more informed about the impact of media sexism by watching the award-winning documentary "Miss Representation" and also for people to start thinking about how they can strive for gender parity in their own lives. 

## Design Decisions

The design decisions I made in putting together the final presentation was as follows:

1. Consistent font and text size: I made sure that the font throughout my presentation was consistent, especially the text that appears in Shorthand and the text that apears in graphics created on other tools like Flourish or Infogram. As the only font available in Flourish is Roboto, that became my default font. I also went back to my graphics to make sure that the labels were of the same size. This focus on consistentcy in font and text size helped improve the readability of the presentation.

## Using Shorthand

Part III: Final data story (due as part of this assignment)

A few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II.  Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.  Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process. (Part III)
Include a link to your updated Github repository that includes a link to your final data story (e.g. a link to your Shorthand / StoryMap or other final project).  Make sure your data story is published and publicly accessible. (Part III)

Include all references for materials used.  It's your responsibility to ensure you have permission to use imagery and other assets, and that you use them appropriately.  A reminder to NOT USE COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - see the library's guide to ensure you are using images correctly.  Make sure to add / update any citations and / or other content that you used to create your data story.  Make sure you have cited external sources correctly.  References should also be clearly identified on your final data story itself.  Review the library's guide if you have questions. (Part III)
Include any other information that helps round out your data story. (Part III)
