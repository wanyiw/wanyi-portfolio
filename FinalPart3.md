# Creating the Final Dataviz Project: My Journey (Part 3: Creating the Final Product)

> The lead-up to the final product incorporated suggestions captured during user feedback, and involved making design decisions to ensure that my data story would resonate with my audience. 

## Changing the Story Sequence

This was the key insight I took away from the user feedback conducted in Part 2 - while certain graphics or images resonated strongly with the participants, most had difficulty with the story flow specifically how one part led to the next. After reflecting on this, I went back to basics and decomposed the story into 5 elements (underrepresentation of women in real life, how the media portrays women, successful attempts at achieving gender parity, benefits of gender parity and the call to action). I played around with different permutations of sequencing the 5 elements and actually got useful feedback from one of the group critique sessions in class. 

I therefore settled on the following sequencing, with attention paid to how each piece connected with the next:

1. Underrepresentation of women in real life (politics, science and business) - This is starting off the presentation because it's the most well-known piece so we're starting with something familiar to the audience. This was an actual suggestion from a participant. 
2. How the media portrays women - I connect this piece to the first by pointing out the similarities between the underrepresentation in real life and how the media portrays women, and then use studies that show the causal relationship between the two. 
3. Successful attempts at achieving gender parity - Having pointed out the causal relationship, I then move into this part which debunks the notion that the gender parity cannot be achieved. In particular, I use the BBC's success story as a counterpoint that the media (if they choose) can achieve gender parity. 
4. Benefits of gender parity - Having established that gender parity is achievable, I discuss why we should do it. This will hopefully get the audience pumped about the next item which is
5. The call to action!

## Clarifying the Call to Action

Another key insight was clarifying the call to action. In some sense, the call to action wasn't clear because it didn't follow after the benefits of gender parity. So the story sequence helped with the motivating the audience to support or execute the call to action. I also added text that elaborated on the 2 calls to action which were to get more informed about the impact of media sexism by watching the award-winning documentary "Miss Representation" and also for people to start thinking about how they can strive for gender parity in their own lives. 

## Design Decisions

The design decisions I made in putting together the final presentation was as follows:

1. Consistent font and text size: I made sure that the font throughout my presentation was consistent, especially the text that appears in Shorthand and the text that apears in graphics created on other tools like Flourish or Infogram. As the only font available in Flourish is Roboto, that became my default font. I also went back to my graphics to make sure that the labels were of the same size. This focus on consistentcy in font and text size helped improve the readability of the presentation.
2. Choosing a consistent color scheme for the text in my data story and the graphics created. I used colorbrewer2 to choose 2 colors to represent the 2 genders, and I decided to use the color for female (a coral) throughout my data story to highlight positive points. Here I was trying to create a mental correlation between the chosen color for females and the positive points or calls to action within the data story.
3. I really struggled to find an appropriate picture for the title slide. None of the pictures on Creative Commons or Unsplash were suitable. In the end, I created my own graphic to use for the title slide, again using the the chosen gender colors for consistency and emphasis right at the start of the data story. 
4. The elements of the story were broken up with a suitable picture at the start of the part. This was to help with the flow of the story. 

## Using Shorthand

It was my first time using Shorthand so there was a bit of a learning curve in terms of how to best build my data story. One thing that I did very frequently was preview the data story just to make sure alignment and rendering were in line with what I had in mind. There were also limitations in Shorthand that made it difficult to work with it. E.g. the scrollmation doesn't allow for custom HTML, only pictures. I therefore had to find workaround, by using spacers. 

Having seen my classmate's successful data sstory using Wix, I'm intrigued to try it out and see if it's a better platform. 

## The Final Product

Here is the final, completed data story - You Can't Be What You Can't See.
