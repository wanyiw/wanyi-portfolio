This is my data visualisation portfolio.

## About me

I am a mom of 2 kids, a police officer by profession, holding a BA History from the London School of Economics. None of these facts suggest that I should have a Github account, much less be building a webpage portfolio of my data visualisations. But such is life. 

I'm a second-year MSPPM student from Singapore. Fall 2021 will be my final semester before heading to Singapore to work in the Government Data Office.

## What I hope to learn 

How to change the world (or at least the very small sliver of the world I live in) through the power of good dataviz. 

More seriously, I'll likely be taking up a job in Singapore's Smart Nation and Digital Government Office upon graduation. Right now, data sounds like a very foreign concept to much of the Singapore civil service. I'm really excited to pick up some techniques on how to make data more accessible through good dataviz, and hopefully start a movement of good dataviz in public communications.

## Portfolio

Akan datang (that means coming soon in the Malay language, which is one of the four official languages in Singapore!).
