## About me

I am a mom of 2 kids, a police officer by profession, holding a BA History from the London School of Economics. None of these facts suggest that I should have a Github account, much less be building a webpage portfolio of my data visualisations. But such is life. 

I'm a second-year MSPPM student from Singapore. Fall 2021 will be my final semester before heading to Singapore to work in the Government Data Office.

## What I hope to learn 

How to change the world (or at least the very small sliver of the world I live in) through the power of good dataviz. 

More seriously, I'll likely be taking up a job in Singapore's Smart Nation and Digital Government Office upon graduation. Right now, data sounds like a very foreign concept to much of the Singapore civil service. I'm really excited to pick up some techniques on how to make data more accessible through good dataviz, and hopefully start a movement of good dataviz in public communications.

### Government Debt Dataviz

This is a data visualisation of government debt using OECD data. A variety of tools were used in creating these visualisations.

### Critique and Redesign Dataviz Assignment

A key element of data visualisation is being able to critique and redesign visualisations. Here is my attempt at critiquing and redesigning a Pew Survey dataviz.

### Final Project

A lot of effort has been dedicated to creating my final project - "You Can't Be What You Can't See". This documents my entire journey through this project, from ideation, wireframing, user feedback to the final product put together on Shorthand. There are 3 parts to this journey, so click on the link below to read Part 1.
